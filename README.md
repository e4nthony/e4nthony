#### My Projects Portfolio:

#### [Encrypted Bookmarks Exporter Add-on for Firefox browser.](https://github.com/e4nthony/Encrypted-Bookmarks-Exporter-Add-on)
This add-on for Firefox browser allows user to export bookmarks into encrypted file to store it locally, as well as decrypt the file and import them from file into browser. 
As part of Cybersecurity Course, I used encrypting algorithms to produce custom encrypted file encrypted with AES-GCM and custom binary file editing. Also, I studied documentation of Firefox and integrated this program into browser as extension. Technologies and Tools Used: Firefox WebExtensions API, JavaScript, CryptoJS library, HTML/CSS

#### [Flight cancellation prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms based on weather data.](https://github.com/e4nthony/flight_cancelation_predict_usingANN)
As part of Artificial Intelligence Course, I implemented automatic dataset creation based on custom time period. It gathers data from different open online sources such as aviation logs and weather data, then combines this data into a one dataset prepared for AI Algorithms. This allowed me run tests to compare and analyze efficiency of vary AI Algorithms. 
Tools: pandas and scikit-learn.

#### Online Auction Platform - BidZone. [Backend](https://github.com/e4nthony/ProjectManagement2023_BE) | [Frontend](https://github.com/e4nthony/ProjectManagement2023_FE)

As part of Project Management course we as a team managed the process of creating a product using Agile-Scrum approach. The site is an online auction marketplace allowing the sellers and buyers to communicate. The project is divided into two different repos Backend and Frontend (i.e. Server-Client) and communicate using http requests. Used Jira and Confluence platform to manage project requirements. Tools: Node.js, Express.js, JavaScript, React
